This repository created to familiarize myself with GitHub as part of the "BitTitan Support Focus Team â€“ Development"

Helloooo to the people that have made it this far. This is my first update in my GitHub readme-edits branch. Tacos a pretty cool, if you're into that kind of thing.

Another update here for Tim to merge into the master branch.
